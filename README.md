r00t is a traveler that's a bit of a myth and legend, leaving traces all over the metaverse and on the blockchains. She shares knowledge and helps people learn new skills.
r00t is the founder of R00TS CLUB. At the club it´s all about having fun and being yourself, no matter what world you're in. And according to r00t, that's what the metaverse is all about: "The metaverse is whatever we make it. It's whatever we dream up. It's ours to create."
R00TS CLUB offers: creativity, community, and endless possibilities. Where lgbtqai+ creators and allies can freely do their thing without judgment or censorship. This club is for creative souls who don't fit into the mainstream. They're the ones who are always experimenting and pushing boundaries. And they wouldn't have it any other way.
r00t welcomes you to this safe space where you can be yourself and create without bounds. So let your imagination run wild, and let's build something amazing—together.
